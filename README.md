# Unfold Recreation - A BeCode Group Project

## Project Description

The Unfold Recreation project is an initiative undertaken by a team of BeCode students to improve their understanding and application of Git, HTML, and CSS. The objective of this project was to recreate the Unfold webpage, putting emphasis on teamwork, Git operations, and conflict resolution strategies.


## Team Members

- **Athi**
- **Leslie**
- **Florentina**

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: HTML was used to structure the webpage, forming the backbone of the project.

- **CSS**: CSS was employed to style the webpage, adding color schemes, fonts, layout adjustments, and more to mirror the aesthetic of Unfold.

- **Git**: Git was the primary tool for version control, enabling the team to work on different parts of the project simultaneously without the risk of overwriting work. It also facilitated tracking changes, making it easier to revert if necessary.

## Teamwork and Collaboration

This project underlined the importance of teamwork and collaboration. Each team member held responsibility for different parts of the project, with seamless integration of work being the ultimate goal. The use of Git's branch feature allowed for independent work, while regular 'pull' and 'merge' operations ensured the smooth combination of everyone's contributions.

Conflict resolution was a significant part of the project. The team learned to navigate and resolve merge conflicts efficiently, ensuring that the project's progress remained steady.
